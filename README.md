## How to translate
If you want to translate my mission to another language you can edit the file [Localization.hpp](https://github.com/alezm00/Arma-Zombie/blob/master/zombie2.grassland/localization.hpp) add your custom language maybe if you want to add the German you have to add to every class the `ger = "some text";` :
```
class STR_PERK_NO_MONEY {
	en = "You do not have enough points";
	it = "Non hai abbastanza punti";
	ger = "some text";
};
```
then after this you have to make a pool request and wait for approval...
